VALUATIOS:
    * Generally we can say that for big companies, historical revnues growth is indicative of       future revneues growth.
    * On the other hand, for smaller companies, reveune growth can be drastic over the next fe      few years, and thus not indicative of future growth.
    ! - should i look more at smaller companies to make more money? probaby not - should look       for undervalued bigger companies, and fast growing small comapnies :-)

    IMPORTANT - i have to consider the market in which a company is a part of.

PREDICTING REVENUES:

    generally there are 2 ways to predicts future revenus:
        1) TOP down - see what the market size is, and what is the market share of the compny            were looking at - good for low volatilty markets and big companies
        2) Bottom up looking at commpany fundulemtals and existsing clients, and expecet the growth of new clients. - better for smaller companies or new markets

    # TODO - use sec insider trading stuff
